<h3>Chairman's Message</h3>
<hr>

    <img src="../Image/chairman.jpg"   alt="Chairman's Message" height="180px"><q id="quotes">There is a difference between how e-Hospital is perceived and what we truly are.</q>
        <h3>Dr. Roshan Prasad Shetty</h3>
        <h5>Founder and Chairman</h5>
 
<p>The world perceives us as a low-cost Indian healthcare service provider; what we are engaged in is a passionate journey to establish ourselves as the lowest-cost, high-quality healthcare service provider in the world.<br><br>

    At e-Hospital, we are convinced that 'quality' and 'lowest cost' are not mutually exclusive when it comes to healthcare delivery. In fact, we are well on our way to demonstrate that we are not running our institution as just another number-only business, but are attractively placed to create an affordable, globally-benchmarked quality-driven healthcare services model.<br><br>
    
    At e-Hospital, we will continue to trust what has worked for us in the past. We will keep our model predominantly asset-light; we will reinvest our accruals; we will engage with governments for land and help them achieve affordable healthcare promises made to their constituencies; we will rent premises from private owners and create small-to-large clinics within existing hospitals. As a result of this flexible approach, we will commission hospitals, medical facilities, and clinics across the breadth of this country, getting closer to patients and taking the promise of quality affordable healthcare to the doorstep of the country's millions.<br><br>
    
    It is this exciting prospect that stokes my motivation to do bigger and better for the glory of the country that is mine.</p>

    <h3>e-Hospital Overview</h3>
    <p>e-Hospital is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and operates a network of hospitals across the country, with a particularly strong presence in the southern state of Karnataka and eastern India, as well as an emerging presence in northern, western and central India. Our first facility was established in Bengaluru with approximately 225 operational beds and we have since grown to 21 Hospitals + 1 Cayman Islands and 6 heart centres, 19 primary care facilities across India and an international hospital in the Cayman Islands. The group now features over 5,859 operational beds through a combination of greenfield projects and acquisitions. We believe that the "e-Hospital" brand is strongly associated with our mission to deliver high-quality, affordable healthcare services to the broader population by leveraging our economies of scale, skilled doctors, and an efficient business model.<br><br>

        In aggregate, our centres provide advanced levels of care in over 30 specialties, including Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery, Cancer Care, Neurology and Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Nephrology and Urology, and Gastroenterology.</p>

       <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to deliver high quality, affordable healthcare services to the broader population in India. Our core values are represented by the acronym "iCare", which encompasses innovation and efficiency, Compassionate care, Accountability, Respect for all, and Excellence as a culture. At the same time, we seek to generate a strong financial performance and deliver long-term value to our shareholders through the execution of our business strategy.</p>

The challenge of the early days was enormous, to foster the fledgling hospital into an enduring symbol of healthcare in the country. We recognised early on that to make a real and substantial contribution one had to redefine the standards themselves- instead of doing more of the same.</a></li>
